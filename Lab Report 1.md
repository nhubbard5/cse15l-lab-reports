Nicholas Hubbard

For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:

    >Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
    *the working directory for all three of the following examples is /home*
    
    -cd did not return anything, because as a command it does not have an output. It simply changes the working directory when given an argument.
    -ls returned "lecture1" because it will return the list of files/folders in the current directory, which is still /home
    -cat does not return anything
    
    Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
    Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
