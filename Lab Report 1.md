For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:

    >Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
    *the working directory for all three of the following examples is /home*
    
    -cd did not return anything, because as a command it does not have an output. It simply changes the working directory when given an argument.

    -ls returned "lecture1" because it will return the list of files/folders in the current directory, which is still /home
