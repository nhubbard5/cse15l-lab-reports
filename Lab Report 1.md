For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:

## Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
    
    -cd did not return anything, because as a command it does not have an output. It simply changes the working directory when given an argument.
    Working directory: /home
    This is not an error, because cd is not meant to return anything.

    -ls returned "lecture1" because it will return the list of files/folders in the current directory, which is still /home
    Working directory: /home
    This is not an error, because it works properly.

    -cat does not return anything
    Working directory: /home
